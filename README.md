# ChatBot-

This Java-based chatbot is designed to simulate a conversation with users by responding to text input with predefined answers. The chatbot leverages simple conditional logic to detect specific keywords or phrases in the user's input and returns corresponding replies. This approach creates a basic yet interactive user experience, allowing for simple dialogues that simulate human-like responses.
User Input Handling: The program captures user input through the console and processes it to detect keywords or patterns.


Keyword-based Responses: The chatbot detects specific keywords from user input and returns a relevant response based on predefined logic.
Easy to Extend: New responses and keywords can be easily added by modifying or extending the existing code.
Text-based Interaction: The chatbot interacts with users through a simple command-line interface, where users input questions or statements, and the bot replies accordingly.
Basic AI Simulation: While the chatbot does not use advanced AI techniques, it mimics basic conversational patterns through if-else or switch-case conditions

Response Logic: Using conditionals, the bot compares the userâ€™s input to a set of predefined patterns and outputs corresponding replies.
Output Display: The chatbot's responses are displayed in the console window, making it easy to track the conversation.
Future Enhancements:
Integration with Natural Language Processing (NLP): Adding an NLP library could allow the chatbot to handle more complex inputs and generate context-aware responses.
GUI Interface: Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) would enhance user experience and provide a more interactive feel compared to the command-line setup.
Learning Capability: Implementing machine learning algorithms would allow the bot to learn from interactions and improve its responses over time.
